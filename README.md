## find the capitals 
Write a function that takes a single string (word) as argument. The function must return an ordered list containing the indexes of all capital letters in the string.

## detect a paragram
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).
Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Multiples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

## int32 to ipv4
Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1
This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).
1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001
So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001
Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the unsigned 32 bit number: 2149583361
Complete the function that takes an unsigned 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address.

## IP adress to a number
An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that identifies a device on the internet.
While computers read and write IP addresses as a 32-bit number, we prefer to read them in dotted-decimal notation, which is basically the number split into 4 chunks of 8 bits, converted to decimal, and delmited by a dot.
In this kata, you will create the function ipToNum (or ip_to_num, depending on the language) that takes an ip address and converts it to a number, as well as the function numToIp (or num_to_ip) that takes a number and converts it to an IP address string. Input will always be valid.

## spilt strings
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

## counting duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

## Dropcaps
DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper.
But for a change, let"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.

## Remove duplicates in a list
Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of non negative numbers and returns it as a result.
The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

## Printing Array elements with Comma delimiters
Input: Array of elements
["h","o","l","a"]
Output: String with comma delimited elements of the array in th same order.
"h,o,l,a"
## consonant value
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".
We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

## strings ends with 
Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).
Examples:
solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false

## Reversed strings
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.
'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'

## multiply
multiply numbers

## even or odd
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

## convert anumber to a string
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a string 
## you'are asquare
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

## highest and lowest

n this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
Examples:
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"

## Add length
What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .
