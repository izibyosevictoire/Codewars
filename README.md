## find the capitals 
Write a function that takes a single string (word) as argument. The function must return an ordered list containing the indexes of all capital letters in the string.

## detect a paragram
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).
Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Multiples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

## int32 to ipv4
Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1
This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).
1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001
So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001
Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the unsigned 32 bit number: 2149583361
Complete the function that takes an unsigned 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address.
